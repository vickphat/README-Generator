## Description: 
This project, I was tasked with creating a generator that would generate a professional README.md file for a project. The generator will prompt a user with a series of questions such as 'What is the name of your project?' and 'Write a breif summary of your project'. After answering all of the prompts, the generator will create a README.md file and transfer the user's response into that README.md file. The generator will also create a 'Table of Contents' to outline the README file. Also, it will have links to bring the reader directly to the section that they want to know more about. 

## Installation: 
The steps required to install this project is 'npm init' and 'npm install inquirer'

## Usage: 
The project is used to quickly create a professional README.md file for a user's project.
